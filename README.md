## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this challenge to learn and practice using Styled Components. Especially valuable was for me learning how to dynamically import and style SVG files, use props in styles and conditionally style app's components.

My second goal was to improve organising my files/folders and components structure. I used some nice resources for that - they're mentioned in appropriate section.

The challenge allowed as well to practice again fetching data from API in React app.

### Useful resources
